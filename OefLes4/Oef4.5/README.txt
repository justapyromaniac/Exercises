this entire exercise has been made in a way to be as accurate to the real world as possible.
I made this in a way to challenge myself more than to just finish an exercise
It is far more complex than anything you'll probably have to make, but do look at this exercise because there might be some things here that can be quite useful

Of course, for GUI's I will also be using this instead of the normal bank GUI we have to make
